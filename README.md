# Creating Pandas Data Frames from Johns Hopkins Raw CSV Files

## Data Sources
* Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 Data Repository https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
* Folium geo json files for U.S. states and counties (with polygon bug fixes for San Francisco County):
  * https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/blob/master/tests/us-counties.json
  * https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/blob/master/tests/us-states.json
* The choropleths at https://first-principles.ai/covid-19/map.html were created from the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data using the code here. The choropleths display
  * U.S. state confirmed cases,
  * U.S. county confirmed cases, and
  * and U.S. per-capita confirmed cases.
